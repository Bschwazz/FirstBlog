            <p> A good citizen in a world of Bits must follow simple guidelines in order to stay safe and responsible. You must always respect other people's right to privacy, never using the tools that you have to do wrong, only right. Always remember that you are being watched by the big companies and things around you because bits are always saved as data in the universe. No matter what, the bits world we live in will be much safer if we stop cyberbullies in their tracks and never turn to cyberbullying ourselves. Continue to follow these guidelines and the bit's world will be a much happier and safer place.</p>

            Encryption breaking quantum computers getting closer:
          </div>
          <div class="split-bio">
            <p> Quantum computers are making a speedy entrance into the world of computer science, with public and private research happening all over the world for their advancement. Although there are many good things that can come from quantum computing, there are also quite a few bad things as well. Quantum computers use bits that can be either a 0 OR a 1, these are known as qubits; regular computers use regular bits that can be only 1 or 0. The negative side of a quantum computer would be the risks that it has on cyber security. Studies from last years "Quantum Safe Workshop" in Toronto predicted that by 2026 there was a 1/7 chance of a quantum computer cracking RSA-2048 encryption, this year that prediction is now a 1/6 chance. Overall, quantum computers will bring a whole new realm of computing to the world of bits, and it will be interesting to see how far it goes. </p>
